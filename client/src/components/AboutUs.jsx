				<p>
					I'm passionate about technology and programming, a journey that led me to create this task management website.
					Inspired by my learning at SoftUni, this platform is designed to help people manage their time more effectively.
					It's an evolving space, constantly improving to meet user needs. My goal is to offer a practical and straightforward
					tool for everyone who seeks better organization in their daily routine. This website reflects my dedication to making
					time management easier and more accessible for all.
